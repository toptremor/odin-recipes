    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My mom has always made this cheesy sausage casserole for us on Christmas morning, and we look forward to eating it every year. It is so delicious, and everyone enjoys it! You can use croutons instead of making toast, and sage sausage for a different flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>6 slices white bread, toasted and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>8 ounces mild Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble sausage into a medium skillet. Cook over medium heat until evenly brown; drain.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together mustard powder, salt, eggs and milk. Add the sausage, bread cubes, and cheese, and stir to coat evenly. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cover, and bake 45 to 60 minutes. Uncover, and reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until set.</li>
    </ol>
